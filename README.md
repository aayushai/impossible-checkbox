### Overview

**Impossible Checkbox** is a fun and interactive project built using React and GSAP, inspired by a bear character interacting with an elusive checkbox. The project showcases playful animations and smooth transitions that bring the checkbox and the bear character to life, making it seem "impossible" for the checkbox to be checked without the bear's interference.

### Features

- **Interactive Checkbox**: The checkbox moves away as you try to check it, giving a humorous challenge.
- **Bear Character Animation**: A bear character, animated using GSAP, reacts dynamically to the user's attempt to click the checkbox.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Fluid animations using GSAP ensure the bear's actions and checkbox movements feel natural and entertaining.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile, ensuring the experience is enjoyable on any screen size.

### Tech Stack

- **React**: Handles the UI and component structure, enabling a smooth and dynamic user experience.
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: Powers the animations, allowing for easy control over the movements of the checkbox and the bear.
- **CSS Modules**: Styles each component individually, providing modular and scoped styling.
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: Lays the foundation for structuring and styling the UI.
